# NodeMcu

The NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform built around the popular ESP8266 Wifi chip.


The ESP8266 is available in a variety of different form factors and multiple commercial products. One of the most significant features of the ESP8266 is the ease with which new firmwares can be uploaded on to it which makes development and customization easy.


These include pre-existing platforms such as ESPEasy - https://www.letscontrolit.com/wiki/index.php/ESPEasy
