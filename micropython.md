Download the latest stable ESP8266 firmware from http://micropython.org/download#esp8266

Flash the firmware, there are mutliple ways to do this but I recommend PyFlasher https://github.com/marcelstoer/nodemcu-pyflasher



# IDEs
There are a number of IDEs available, pick which everone works best for you...
  ESPCut - http://espcut.com/ - A portable version of the software is available 
  uPyCraft - https://github.com/DFRobot/uPyCraft
  ESPlorer - https://esp8266.ru/esplorer/
  EsPy - https://github.com/jungervin/EsPy

Beware of flashing code containing infinite loops as while the code is running you will be unable to upload new files.
